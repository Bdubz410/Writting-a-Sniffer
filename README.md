With this project I built a UDP host discovery tool. This sniffer simply sniffs just one network packet on the wire; must run in command prompt as admin and will not have tracebacks.
This sniffers main goal is to discover hosts on a target network
This host scanner is implemented to scan Windows and Linux systems.
I will be adding more code to make the scanner more functional in the near future but for now this was a fun project to get my feet wet in the world of IT.
